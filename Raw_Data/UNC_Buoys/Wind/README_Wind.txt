Wind data were collected on-board each vertical profiler at approximately 4m above the waterline.

Samples were taken once per second and averaged for ten minutes.
	"speed_scalar"		Average wind speed in m/s
	"dir_unit_vector"	Average wind direction in degrees
	"speed_vector"		Vector averaged wind speed
	"dir_vector"		Vector averaged direction
	"compass_dir"		Direction of the sensor itself, used in wind direction calculations
	"dir_uncorrected"	Direction relative to the sensor, used in wind direction calculations
