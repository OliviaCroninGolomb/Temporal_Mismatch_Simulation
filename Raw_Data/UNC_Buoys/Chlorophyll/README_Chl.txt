Two autonomous verical profilers took measurements at three different sites in Jordan Lake 
(Haw River, White Oak and New Hope). 

Data collected since May of 2017 can be found in their respective folders. They are uploaded 
as daily DAT files where the columns from A to J represent:

date the profile was taken, the time, tempurature (deg C), conductivity (millisiemens/cm), 
salinity (psu), depth (m), pH, turbitiy (ntu), chlorophyl (micrograms/L), dissolved oxygen (mg/L)

This data is not continuous at every site. There are data missing for the days where the 
profiler was moved or maitained for some reason. The data in the Post-Processed Data folder 
has been post-processed to account for the calibration of the instruments that were switched 
out on the profilers. Additionally, outliers in the data have been eliminated (may result 
from sensor drift) and we implemented a bidirectiona butterworth filter on the chlorophyl 
and the turbidity data. The Raw Data folder was directly uploaded from the profilers with 
no additional changes. 

A month by month graphical summary is included in the graphical summaries folder.
